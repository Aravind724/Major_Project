***  HUMAN STRESS DETECTION BASED ON SLEEPING HABITS USING MACHINE LEARNING ***

Human stress, often triggered by challenging environments, significantly impacts overall well-being.
Our Project focuses on detecting human stress through sleep-related behaviors using machine learning and deep learning techniques. 
Six machine learning algorithms, including Naïve Bayes, and deep learning methods  and deeper neural networks were tested.
The Naïve Bayes algorithm stood out, achieving 91.27% accuracy.
Our Project main objective is to investigate how human stress might be detected using machine learning algorithms based on sleep-related behaviours.

Sleep Disruptions are often sign of a Stress.
Monitoring stress levels is crucial to reduce its adverse effects on health.
Sleep behaviors are closely linked to stress, with disruptions in sleep patterns.
Various machine learning algorithms can analyze sleep data to detect stress.
Stress detection using sleep behaviors can lead to improved stress management. 

Designing a Human Stress Detection System based on sleep habits involves careful planning and testing, using sleep data and user input.
By analyzing factors like sleep duration, quality, patterns, and movement, machine learning can help identify signs of stress. 
Although this technology offers a promising way to understand our well-being. Also, privacy and consent issues need to be considered to ensure responsible use of personal data. 
Despite these challenges, this approach has great potential for improving stress management and overall health.
